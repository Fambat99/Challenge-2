        Nobody’s born smart. <strong>We all start at 0</strong>. <em>Can’t talk</em>, <em>can’t walk</em>, certainly <em>can’t do algebra</em>.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first</strong>.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein <strong>couldn’t count to 10</strong>.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, <strong>we are born to learn</strong>.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely</em>. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <strong>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling</strong>.<br>
        Until one day, <strong>you walk</strong>.<br>
        <em>One foot in front of the other</em>. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        <strong>Failing is just another word for growing</strong>. And <em>you keep going</em>.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <strong>yet</strong>.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere can understand</strong>.<br>
        <strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are</strong>.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn <em>anything</em>.</strong>
